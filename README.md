# RA on GameCube with libogc2 support


See dist-scripts folder for zipped core sources.


This is mainly identical to my original RA fork (known as Hexaeco or Shin-RA) but has fixes that allows it to compile on the latest devkitppc.

ARAM is not used in any core, so there is much room to improve.


This is currently not made with the Wii in mind, and since it is based on a 2015 build of RA, this will probably remain a hard fork and separate from the Wii version, which is still stuck with the older devkit.
